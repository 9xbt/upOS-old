## Building on Linux
Prerequisites:
- make
- nasm
- qemu
- cdrtools

To install them simply run `sudo apt install prerequisite-here` on ubuntu-based distros<br>or `sudo pacman -S prerequisite-here` on arch-based distros.

Before you build it, you should set up a Makefile.<br>
(Note: The makefile is no longer included because the makefile sometimes varies from computer to computer)

It should look something like this if you are on linux: 
```
all: build
	qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom kernel.iso

build:
	nasm -f bin -o kernel.bin src/kernel.asm
	mv kernel.bin bin/kernel.bin
	mkisofs -b kernel.bin -no-emul-boot -o kernel.iso bin/
	
clean:
	rm -rvf kernel.bin
	rm -rvf kernel.iso
```

Then to build and run, simply run `make all` in the terminal.

## Building on Windows
Prerequisites:
- nasm
- qemu
- cdrtools

Most of these can be found with a Google search.<br>
(Note: I had to add all of them to the path before I could get it to work, most of them don't do by default.)

Make a .bat file to compile and run, it should look something like this:
```
nasm -f bin -o kernel.bin src/kernel.asm
move /Y kernel.bin bin
mkisofs -b kernel.bin -no-emul-boot -o kernel.iso bin/
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom kernel.iso
```
Then run the .bat file.
